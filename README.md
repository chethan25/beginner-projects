1. Guess The Number - The computer will think of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess,
the computer will tell the user whether the number is too high or too low. The user wins if they can guess the number within
five tries.

2. Hangman Game - Hangman is a game for two people in which one player thinks of a word and then draws a blank line on the
page for each letter in the word. The second player then tries to guess letters that might be in the word. If the second
player guesses the letter correctly, the first player writes the letter in the proper blank. But if the second player guesses
incorrectly, the first player draws a single body part of a hanging man. The second player has to guess all the letters in the
word before the hanging man is completely drawn to win the game.

3. Rename - A python script to rename large amounts of files based on files extensions.
